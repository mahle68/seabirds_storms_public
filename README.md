Morphology determines extreme winds for seabird

Storms can cause widespread seabird strandings and wrecking, yet little is known about the maximum wind speeds that birds are able to tolerate or the conditions they avoid. We analyzed > 300,000 hours of tracking data from 18 seabird species, including flapping and soaring fliers, to quantify the wind speeds used during the breeding season in relation to those available. We found no general preference nor avoidance of particular wind speeds, indicating that wind did not strongly shape decision-making processes for central place foragers. Instead, we suggest that seabirds are adapted to a “wind niche”, where species with higher wing loading are selected for a life in windier environments. In support of this, wing loading was positively related to the median wind speeds on the breeding grounds and the maximum wind speeds in which birds flew. Importantly, the highest wind speeds occurred in the tropics (in association with tropical cyclones) where birds are morphologically adapted to low median wind speeds. These species should therefore show behavioral responses to extreme winds, which likely include long-range avoidance. We also discovered a very small number of instances where albatrosses avoided strong winds at close-range, demonstrating that even the most wind-adapted birds occasionally avoid extreme speeds. Extreme winds appear to pose context-dependent risks to seabirds, and there is a need for more information on the factors that determine the hierarchy of risk, given the impact of global change on storm intensity.
